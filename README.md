OpenAPI 3.0 Specification for Azure Standard's API.

## Style guide

`summary` values are essentially headings. The first character of the string should always be capitalized. They should never end in a period.

`description` values should be formatted with normal sentence formatting. They should always end with a period. Markdown is supported for rich-text formatting. Use one space between sentences (not two).
